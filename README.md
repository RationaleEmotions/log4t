# Log4T

Stands for Logger for test methods.

Currently, this logger is hard-wired to be used only with `log4j`

## Pre-requisites

1. TestNG `7.4.0`
2. JDK8

## Salient features

* Always generates a log file on a per test method basis.
* The logger does not take into account a test method with multiple invocations and a test method powered by a data provider.
* Log file names are fully qualified class names along with the method name.
* All logs are by default available in the `logs` directory.
* Captures log messages generated ONLY by a test method.
* Supports being invoked ONLY from within a `@Test` (or) `@BeforeXXX|@AfterXXX` methods.
* Does not capture logs generated by API calls that the current test method makes.
* The log file name of a test method is available as an attribute in its `ITestResult` object with a key named `log4t.logs`

## How to use

```java
Log4T.getLogger().info("testMethod1");
```

## Customisation

In-case, you would like to customize the directory or the pattern etc., following would need to be done

1. Implement the interface `com.rationaleemotions.IAppenderInfo`
2. Create a folder `META-INF/services` in your resources directory.
3. Create a file named `com.rationaleemotions.IAppenderInfo` in the newly created directory.
4. Refer the fully qualified class name of your implementation from (1) into this file.
